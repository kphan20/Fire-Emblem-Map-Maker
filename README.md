# Fire-Emblem-Map-Maker

This is a browser-based map editor that allows you to create GBA-era Fire Emblem maps. It was written in React-Redux with a Node.js/MongoDB backend, and it supports my other Fire Emblem project.

I developed this with the following purposes in mind:

- Deepen my React.js skills and gain exposure to Redux
- Learn some Node.js
- Learn how MongoDB interfaces with Node.js
- Develop a system to store maps in a database

As of now, the following features are available:

- Creating map of specified dimensions
- Filling in the tiles with tiles from a tileset
- Drag-filling on the map canvas
- Keeping a hotbar to easily select tiles
- Submitting a completed map for storage in a MongoDB database

I would like to support more tilesets and design a better appearance.
